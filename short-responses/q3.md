# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in a `controller` as the second argument.

What is a controller?

# Answer
A controller is a function or a set of functions that handle the incoming requests to an endpoint and determine the response sent back to the client. In this assignment these are the functions inside index.js. They are used to handle the logic for when the client navigates to different pages/endpoints.
